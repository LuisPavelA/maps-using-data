# Maps with Data 

### In this project I created maps with some locations data using the following:
- The data was taken from Kaggle:
  - [Earthquake Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/earthquake-database)
  - [Volcano Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/volcanoes-on-earth-in-2021)
- Geopandas
- Numpy
- The code was also run in a Jupyter notebook in the cloud using Kaggle
